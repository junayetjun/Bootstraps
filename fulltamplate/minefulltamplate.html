    <strong>Apple is a company known for continuing to innovate from the very beginning until today. One of the most
      seriously anticipated technologies before now is Apple Intelligence. Despite good intentions, Apple does not seem
      to trust its fan base with this new power and will soon be switching Apple Intelligence on by default with the
      upcoming iOS 18.3 and macOS 15.3 updates. This raises a serious question: If Apple Intelligence is that awesome,
      why not trust us to turn it on by ourselves?</strong>

    <p>The company was founded to produce and market Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Its second computer, the Apple
      II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and
      the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985,
      internal company problems led to Jobs leaving to form NeXT, Inc., and Wozniak withdrawing to other ventures; John
      Sculley served as long-time CEO for over a decade. In the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market share in the
      personal computer industry to the lower-priced Wintel duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on
      Intel-powered PC clones. In 1997, Apple was weeks away from bankruptcy. To resolve its failed operating system
      strategy, it bought NeXT, effectively bringing Jobs back to the company, who guided Apple back to profitability
      over the next decade with the introductions of the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad devices to critical acclaim as
      well as the iTunes Store, launching the "Think different" advertising campaign, and opening the Apple Store retail
      chain. These moves elevated Apple to consistently be one of the world's most valuable brands since about 2010.
      Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later; he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.</p>

    <p>The International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) and the International Network for Acid Prevention (INAP)
      launched a new toolkit meant to assist mining companies in resolving environmental issues concerning acid rock
      drainage (ARD) and mine leaching (ML). This management tool thus aims at minimising water pollution and lowering
      remediation costs in the long run to enhance sustainable industrial practices.
      The Tool for Acid Rock Drainage and Metal Leaching Prevention and Management gives a comprehensive road map for the management of materials during the entire lifecycle of mining
    activities—from exploration to post-closure management of a mining site—thus minimising the likelihood of
    discharging highly acidic water containing metal as a potential byproduct of mining operations.</p>

    <p>The emerging trend of swicy, which essentially involves combining sweet and spicy flavours, is a classic example of how the industry continues to evolve. In that regard, the prospects are very promising for a particular spice in 2025. According to McCormick, a world-renowned brand of seasoning and spices, the ají amarillo will be the “flavour of the year.”. It is chilli and indigenous to South America. Soon, diners are expected to find this colourful condiment inside establishments, households, and even bartenders. Many people eat spicy food, but each has its favourite type of chilli. And for instance, ají amarillo is one of those. It is cherished for its bright colour, yellow to orange, and aromas, which do not overpower each other but can be described as sweetish and hot. Some people will also say that the taste reminds them of passionfruit or mango. In any case, it is fairly hot with almost the same degree as chilli pepper, although the heat distribution is different. That is why chefs find it easier to cook with when they don’t intend to burn their diners’ taste buds.</p>
